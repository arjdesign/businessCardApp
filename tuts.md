// Dart:

type : var, double, 
// dart also has type inference. 
// dart is oop
// constructor is function that executes only once when we create a class
}

named argument is great for the constructors that use lots of variable as input arguments.
without non named, now you need to remember the postion of the arguments.  

//flutter understands @required.
